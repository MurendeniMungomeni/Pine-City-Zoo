<h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
<p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their incredible intelligence, memory, and strong social bonds.<p>These gentle giants are easily recognized by their long trunks, large ears, and powerful tusks. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, smelling, touching, grasping, and communicating with one another.</p> <p>They live in close-knit family groups and are known to show emotions like joy, grief, and compassion. At the zoo, you can often find them cooling off in water, playing with enrichment toys, or interacting with their caretakers. </p><p>Elephants play a vital role in their natural habitats, helping to shape the environment for other species.</p>
